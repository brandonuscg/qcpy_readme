# QCPY - Quantum Computing for Python

QCPY is an open-source Python library designed for simulating and visualizing quantum circuits. It provides an intuitive interface for building quantum algorithms, exploring quantum mechanics concepts, and leveraging GPU acceleration for quantum simulations.

## üìå Features
- Construct and manipulate quantum circuits
- Apply quantum gates (Pauli, Hadamard, T, Controlled, etc.)
- Simulate quantum states and amplitudes
- GPU-accelerated quantum computations
- Visualize circuits with Q-spheres, Bloch spheres, and state vector diagrams

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Creating a Quantum Circuit

You can create a simple quantum circuit using the `QuantumCircuit` class:

```python
from qcpy import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(qubits=3)
qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate with control 0 and target 1
print(qc.state)  # Print quantum state
```

For advanced examples, see the [Usage Guide](usage.md).

## üìö Learning Quantum Computing

New to quantum computing? Start with the [Introduction & Prerequisites](prerequisites.md), covering:
- What are qubits?
- Basic quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli, CNOT, etc.)
- Concepts of superposition and entanglement

Explore the **[Quantum Gates Reference](gates.md)** for a deeper understanding.

## üé® Visualizing Quantum Circuits

QCPY includes built-in visualization tools:

```python
from qcpy import QuantumCircuit, visualize

qc = QuantumCircuit(qubits=3)
qc.h([0, 1, 2])

visualize.qsphere(qc)  # Display Q-Sphere representation
```

More visualization methods are detailed in the [Visualization Guide](visualization.md).
